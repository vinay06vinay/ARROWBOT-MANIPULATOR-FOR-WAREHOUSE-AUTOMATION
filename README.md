# ARROWBOT-MANIPULATOR-FOR-WAREHOUSE-AUTOMATION
Arrowbot is the name of the wheeled manipulator designed and simulated to perform autonomous tasks of pick and place in warehouse.

The project is designed as part of the coursework. The implementation details and applications can be found in report.

How to Run?
1) Refer to the Instructions.txt to use the package and files

The following objectives were accomplished during the course of this project:
1) Develop an inverse kinematics solver based on geometric approach for calculations of Joint angles of the UR5 manipulator
2) Integration of a gripper to pickup objects with the manipulator and defining services for the gripper activation
3) Pick and place from a known pick coordinate to a placing coordinate.

The robots final motion using in gazebo simulation using the solver script can be seen as below:
